/*
In this program, we want the net cost of a phone call. At certain hours of the
day and call lengths (duration), the phone service provider gives discounted rates.
The program starts by asking for two user inputs: start time (24-hour clock format
without the colon) and the duration of the call. Assuming both values are correctly
built, the computer computes the gross cost, applies all possible discounts and 
taxes. At the end, the computer prints out the net cost of the phone call.
