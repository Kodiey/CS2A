This program prompts the user to convert number of pounds (lb) to ounces (oz).
Unlike the program from assignment 1, this program prompts the user by
asking a question: whether the user would like to convert more pounds to
ounces. It will continue as long as the user keeps typing the letter 'Y'. Else,
the program will end.
