a5_3.cpp

This program prompts the user to enter a filename and it will open up
a file stream and count the number of words are in the text file. This 
was tricky beacuse the files must be in the same working directory as
this program. So, basically, when the user enters a string (filename),
the program will invoke a library fstream opens the file and reads it 
and then closes the file. At the end of the program, it will display
the number of words (delimited by white space) are in the text file.
